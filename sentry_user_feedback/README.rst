====================
Sentry User Feedback
====================

Module allows users to provide additional feedback on Sentry events once a user-facing exception occurs.

.. note:: Sentry logging via the ``sentry`` addon must be enabled.
.. note:: The user feedback dialog is only displayed in Odoo backend.
.. note:: The user feedback dialog is not displayed in debug mode (usual Odoo
   error dialog is displayed).
.. note:: As the user feedback dialog is loaded from a different origin,
   anti-tracking browser addons might block the request.
